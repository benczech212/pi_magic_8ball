  weight: 9
  type: 'Yes'

  weight: 9
  type: 'No'

  weight: 9
  type: 'No'
- text: Yes. Elegant and sufficient.

  weight: 8
  type: 'No'

  weight: 8
  type: 'Yes'

  weight: 8
  type: 'No'

  weight: 7
  type: 'No'
- text: Yes. This is well within spec.
  weight: 7
  type: 'Yes'
- text: No. This creates more cleanup than joy.
  weight: 7
  type: 'No'
- text: Yes. Controlled chaos approved.
  weight: 6
  type: 'Yes'
- text: No. This violates common sense.
  weight: 6
